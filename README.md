# Snake-Game

This is a two-player game. The main objective of this game is to make the snakes chase after the apples. The default colors of the snakes are purple and green. Each player controls a purple or green-colored snake and makes it eat apples corresponding to the snake's color. The purple snake is controlled using the keys D (right), A (left), W (up), S (down), and the green snake is controlled using the arrow keys. As the snakes eat apples, they grow longer; hence the players should make sure that the snakes don't eat their tails when making turns. 

# Rules of the game:
* Game ends when either snake reaches the max score of 10
* When the snake hits the wall, it's score reduces by 1 and it's length also reduces. 
* Game ends when either snake eats it's own tail
* Purple snake is controlled by D: Right, A: Left, W: Up, S: Down
* Green snake is controlled by →: Right, ←: Left, ↑: Up, ↓: Down
